# gone-web

This is a blog built with typescript, next.js and tailwindcss.

I write it for me, but if you find it useful, that's great, if you can help me improve it, that's even better.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/utils.ts`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
